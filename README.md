This Hospital Management System is a modern, responsive, and feature-rich website developed to simplify and digitize healthcare services. It provides easy access to appointment booking, patient portals, multilingual support, ambulance services, and more — built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js (future).

Inspiration & Vision
The goal is to digitize the hospital experience for both patients and staff — especially in public and multispecialty hospitals where long queues and record mismanagement are common. This HMS is built to improve efficiency, reduce paperwork, and bring healthcare to your fingertips.
